## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project is divided into two primary sub-systems:

1.  **`engine/` (Go)**: The core security analysis engine. It handles AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing and rule evaluation at high speeds.
2.  **`extension/` (TypeScript)**: The VS Code extension layer that provides the diagnostics UI, hovers, quick fixes, and the security dashboard.
